# Milestone 2   16 / 20

## Marking Guide

- technical writing is clear and concise (key decisions are documented; organization is easy to follow; basic English spelling and writing conventions adhered to)
- design follows basic principles like cohesion/coupling, single responsibility, open/closed
- design addresses QAR from M1
- design provides path for implementing user stories in M1
- design models follow conventions for class and sequence diagrams
- design justifies technology choices
- ADRs (3+) explain why decision was taken, what the context is, and what alternatives were rejected
- ADRs don't capture trivial design decisions

## Notes M2

(explaining why marks were deducted)
-----

- Not the best writing. The Sequence diagram is not found by clicking on the link on section 2.1 Backend Architecture. There is a broken link on section 3.1.2.3 Frontend consistency (-1)
- The Sequence diagram only outlines backend but does not outline the individual responsibilities of the backend. Could have broken them down into modules and outline responsibilities for every modules. (-1)
- ADRs are not explained in terms of what choices were there on hand (-1)
- There are no explanations of why a particular choice was made (-1)
