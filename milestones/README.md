# Course Info
You made it!

The structure of this file is pretty simple, each milestone gets its own directory
for any special requirements that are needed for that milestone.

# Are you marking milestone one?
Hey you handsome devil, just navigate to that milestone 1 subfolder to see
all of the requirements written up in an easy to grok manner. It also
describes how we've integrated the requirements into the project's issue format.

If you don't want to go that far to see how its integrated, its pretty simple;

User stories => projects

CI Quality Attributes => issues labeled with "course" and something else

Quality Attributes not implemented in CI => issues labeled with only "course"
