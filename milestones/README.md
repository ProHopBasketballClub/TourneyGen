# Course Info
You made it!

The structure of this file is pretty simple, each milestone gets its own directory
for any special requirements that are needed for that milestone.

# Are you marking milestone one?
Hey you handsome devil, just navigate to that milestone 1 subfolder to see
all of the requirements written up in an easy to grok manner. It also
describes how we've integrated the requirements into the project's issue format.

If you don't want to go that far to see how its integrated, its pretty simple;

User stories => projects

CI Quality Attributes => issues labeled with "course" and something else

Quality Attributes not implemented in CI => issues labeled with only "course"

# No? Ok, How about milestone two?
**Q)** Are you the marker for milestone two?  
**A)** Well, you're in this section, so you must be!

Good news for you, its easier than ever to mark milestone two! The milestone 2 directory's readme will walk you through the projected design of the system from a high level. This readme (doc) will explain how the larger portions of the system will interact with each other. For a more granular breakdown of how each peice will be implemented, take a look at our [projects](https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-team-3-9/projects "Team 3-9 projects"). If you're looking for the stages of development, take a look at our [milestones](https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-team-3-9/milestones "Team 3-9 milestones") They relate the project milestone to what we need to actually have done to be on schedule!

Hope you're having a good day Mr.Marker. And remember, if you're not having a good day, you can always mark other teams until you are!
