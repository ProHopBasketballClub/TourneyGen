# Milestone 1

### User Stories:

Each of these user stories are captured in relating projects (linked). These projects each contain issues which make up the body of work required to make that user story work. Further, captured within the [milestones](https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-team-3-9/milestones "Team 3-9 System Milestones") of the project are the steps and general order that we are going to take to implement the system.

[1.](https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-team-3-9/projects/1 "Base webpage project") As a football league owner, I need to manage my league’s tournaments and matches so I can maintain an organized structure within my league.

[2.](https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-team-3-9/projects/7 "Add tournaments project") As a tournament organizer I need to create a tournament which users can leave before the bracket is created. Once the bracket is created, the teams can no longer leave so that the bracket is not disrupted by teams leaving. I need the tournament to have the ability to be viewed publicly by teams within the tournament so they can see who they play as the tournament progresses. 

[3.](https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-team-3-9/projects/6 "Adding matches project") As a esports competitive league owner I need to track league participants’ skill based on some score which reflects their ranking so that I can differentiate the skill level of each team.

[4.](https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-team-3-9/projects/2 "User home page project") As an e-sports gaming manager, I need to manage multiple leagues in one place so that I can easily track all of the leagues for the different esports that I run. 

[5.](https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-team-3-9/projects/3 "Adding teams to league project") As a league owner, I need to add and remove teams from my league as the league members change. 

[6.](https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-team-3-9/projects/4 "Change team info project")  As a team owner I need to manage my team info so I can keep track of my team’s roster and other information.

[7.](https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-team-3-9/projects/5 "Adding teams to home page project") As a coach for 4 different teams, I need to manage all 4 teams within their leagues from one place.

### Quality Attributes:

The quality attributes of this system are caputres in 7 tickets (GH-1, GH-2, GH-3, GH-4, GH-5, GH-6, and GH-7.) Three of these tickets (GH-3, GH-5, and GH-6) all expain how testing for them should be implemented in the actual system. Others are simpy there as a course requirements, and will be considered in implementation. For easy reference, the 7 quality attributes are included here:
