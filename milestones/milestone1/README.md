# Milestone 1

### User Stories:

1. As a football league owner, I need to manage my league’s tournaments and matches so I can maintain an organized structure within my league.

2. As a tournament organizer I need to create a tournament which users can leave before the bracket is created. Once the bracket is created, the teams can no longer leave so that the bracket is not disrupted by teams leaving. I need the tournament to have the ability to be viewed publicly by teams within the tournament so they can see who they play as the tournament progresses. 

3. As a esports competitive league owner I need to track league participants’ skill based on some score which reflects their ranking so that I can differentiate the skill level of each team.

4. As an e-sports gaming manager, I need to manage multiple leagues in one place so that I can easily track all of the leagues for the different esports that I run. 

5. As a league owner, I need to add and remove teams from my league as the league members change. 

6.  As a team owner I need to manage my team info so I can keep track of my team’s roster and other information.

7. As a coach for 4 different teams, I need to manage all 4 teams within their leagues from one place.
