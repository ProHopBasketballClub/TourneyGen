# Team 3-9  -  SENG-350
Hello, we're team 3-9. We're not really sure what the
requirement to include 'you team's name' means, so 
we will from now on be known as 'Panznir',
a portmanteau of Mjolnir and Panzer, the only
ideas we had for a team name.

Ignore all the other code and Jenkins stuff you see here
we *promise* we haven't already started development.

# Project ideas
If you ignore the source code, you can also live with the
idea that we haven't already selected out idea.

## Idea I - TourneyGen
What is TourneyGen? Simple, its a webapp you can go to 
if you want to create a tournament bracket for a game.
But that's not it, you can also go here to set up a 
skill-tracked league where each match will update
the skill rating of any teams. Furthr, you can 
organize as many tournaments as you would like
within that league! sounds fun

## Idea II - Cloud Compute Framework
Building off a group project from SENG-371, a cloud
compute framework can be further fleshed out. 

## Idea III - Scheduling web-app
Building off a group project from SENG-321, a web-app
for managing shifts at a bakery could be implemented based
off a 130 page spec.
